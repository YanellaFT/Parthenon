# parthenon — a murder mystery typing game

a slightly creepy typing game where you attempt to escape the wrath of the goddesses with whom you are trapped in a metro station. they want to sacrifice you, just as they did to seshat, the goddess of writing, knowledge, and measurement. this is your only chance to escape - think fast, and type even faster.
