            <p>The Parthenon gods have summoned you, <strong>Athena</strong>, to their hideout. Now, you have landed in a closed off subway station in New York. <br>It turns out, the gods are not as good as they seem. They are evil, and use other gods as sacrifices in hopes to get out. <br>Since it is the 21st century, instead of battling it out by hand, they challenge you to a typing game. <br>Win the following typing games to make it out alive and not turn into the next sacrifice. 
Seshat– the god of writing, knowledge, and measurement– was their last sacrifice, and they’ll give you hints and tips to hopefully help you.
