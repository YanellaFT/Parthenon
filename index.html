Now, you have landed in a closed off subway station in New York. <br>It turns out, the gods are not as good as they seem. They are evil, and use other gods as sacrifices in hopes to get out. <br>Since it is the 21st century, instead of battling it out by hand, they challenge you to a typing game. <br>Win the following typing games to make it out alive and not turn into the next sacrifice.</p>
            <p id="text-intro">Seshat– the god of writing, knowledge, and measurement– was their last sacrifice, and they’ll give you hints and tips to help you out.</p>
